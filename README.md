## Exercise 1.1 – Intro to Python Programming

### Overview

This first exercise focuses on setting up the development environment and creating a simple Python script. It also introduces virtual environments and Python’s package management using pip.

### Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.13.4
- Virtual Environments (via `venv`)
- Visual Studio Code
- IPython
- pip

### Steps Completed

1. **Installed Python 3.13.4**  
   Confirmed using `python3 --version`.

2. **Created a virtual environment**  
   Created one called `cf-python-base` and activated it.

3. **Wrote and ran a Python script `add.py`**  
   A simple script that prompts the user for two integers, adds them, and prints the result.

4. **Installed and tested IPython**  
   IPython was installed and launched inside the virtual environment for enhanced shell features.

5. **Exported environment dependencies**  
   Used `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to list the installed packages.

6. **Created a second environment `cf-python-copy`**  
   Installed packages listed in `requirements.txt` to verify environment cloning.

7. **Documented the setup and learning**  
   Added all necessary files to a folder named `Exercise-1.1`.

### Deliverables (in `Exercise-1.1/` folder)

- `add.py`: A script that adds two user-input numbers.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all packages installed in the virtual environment.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `learning-journal.md`: Reflections and notes about this exercise.
- `Screenshots`: Documenting the process
