# Python for Web Developers Specialization

## Achievement 1: Command-Line Recipe App

This repository contains my work for **Achievement 1** of the Python for Web Developers course. The goal was to progressively build a command-line Recipe App while learning Python fundamentals, file handling, OOP, and database integration.

---

### Exercises & Tasks

#### Exercise 1.1

* Installed Python and set up virtual environments.
* Wrote a simple script (`add.py`) to add two numbers.
* Practiced using pip, requirements.txt, and environment replication.

#### Exercise 1.2

* Practiced Python data structures (lists & dictionaries).
* Stored recipes as dictionaries and organized them in a list.
* Accessed and printed structured recipe data.

#### Exercise 1.3

* Combined user input, functions, loops, and conditionals.
* Built a script (`Exercise_1.3.py`) to take multiple recipes and calculate difficulty levels.
* Practiced uniqueness tracking and sorted ingredient lists.

#### Exercise 1.4

* Introduced file persistence using the `pickle` module.
* Created two scripts: `recipe_input.py` and `recipe_search.py`.
* Learned binary file handling, exception management, and recipe searching.

#### Exercise 1.5

* Applied **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to the Recipe app.
* Created a `Recipe` class with attributes and methods for ingredients, difficulty, and searching.
* Converted recipes from dictionaries into objects.
* Built `recipe_oop.py` and tested multiple recipe objects.

#### Exercise 1.6

* Integrated the Recipe app with **MySQL** using the `mysql.connector` package.
* Built a menu-driven CLI (`recipe_mysql.py`) with CRUD functionality:

  * Create recipes
  * Search recipes by ingredient
  * Update recipes
  * Delete recipes
* Stored ingredients as comma-separated strings in the database.

#### Exercise 1.7

* Finalized the Recipe app using **SQLAlchemy ORM** for cleaner database handling.
* Defined a `Recipe` model mapped to a `final_recipes` table.
* Implemented full CRUD operations with ORM queries in `recipe_app.py`.
* Built a main menu-driven CLI to manage recipes.

### Reflection

Achievement 1 was a gradual build-up from Python basics to building a full CRUD application with database integration. Each exercise added a new layer of complexity, leading to a final project that felt like a real-world application. The step-by-step approach made it easier to grasp how Python can powerfully interact with data and databases.
